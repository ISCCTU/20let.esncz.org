      <h3>Are you getting bored between the plenaries? No way!</h3>

      <p>We prepared for you NA Brno Game which will make your NA more fun, and you will have the opportunity to meet
        new
        people.</p>

      <h4>So what is the game about?</h4>

      <p>Firstly you will be divided into teams. You can find the names of your team members inside the Welcome
        Pack.</p>

      <p>On Friday and Saturday, there will be <em>six big tasks</em> you will have to complete in the team at a
        specific time.
        These tasks will be for 10 points each, and your team has to do them all and together! We will share these tasks
        with you <strong>every day at 12:00, 15:00, and 18:00</strong>.</p>

      <h4>Are the big tasks not enough for you?</h4>

      <p>Don't worry! We prepared some extra tasks for you. They can be done just by one team player and are easy and
        <em>fun
          to do!</em> You can get some extra points for them! But be careful; these tasks have numbers on them, and you
        can do
        each number just once.</p>

      <h4>Where can you find the <em>small tasks?</em></h4>

      <p>It will be hidden in envelopes everywhere during our NA Brno dobr√Ω. Just <strong>watch carefully!</strong> We
        will tell you more
        details about where to look later.</p>

      <h4>How will you get the points?</h4>

      <p>We created a special Instagram account where you have to send us all the tasks you will finish. All you have to
        do
        is send us a picture/video, the number of tasks you did, and your team name! <strong>By sending us a
          picture/video you agree that we can post it later.</strong></p>

      <p>
