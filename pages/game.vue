      <p class="text-center">We prepared for you NA Brno Game which will make your NA more fun, and you will have the
        opportunity to meet
        new
        people.</p>

      <h4>So what is the game about?</h4>

      <p>Firstly you will be divided into teams. You can find the names of your team members inside the Welcome
        Pack.</p>

      <img alt="Let's dig into it!" class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-1/2 md:w-1/2" src="../assets/game.webp">

      <p>On Friday and Saturday, there will be <u>six big tasks</u> you will have to complete in the team at a
        specific time.
        These tasks will be for 10 points each, and your team has to do them all and together! We will share these tasks
        with you <strong>every day at 12:00, 15:00, and 18:00</strong>.</p>

      <h4>Are the big tasks not enough for you?</h4>

      <p>Don't worry! We prepared some extra tasks for you. They can be done just by one team player and are easy and
        <u>fun
          to do!</u> You can get some extra points for them! But be careful; these tasks have numbers on them, and you
        can do
        each number just once.</p>

      <h4>Where can you find the <u>small tasks?</u></h4>

      <p>It will be hidden in envelopes everywhere during our NA Brno dobr√Ω. Just <strong>watch carefully!</strong> We
        will tell you more
        details about where to look later.</p>
